                    <p> Millions of gallons of water are wasted every single day. On average, every American uses 17.2 gallons of water everytime
                    they shower. More water is also wasted whenever someone washes their hands or flushes the toilet. After only one use, this water 
                    is simply drained through plumbing pipes until it is released into the ocean or treated at a water treatment facility. Even though the energy 
                    from the water flowing through the pipes is a significant amount, no solution harnessing this energy for the benefit of the user has
                    been created. </p>

                    <p> Our team's original solution is Wattergen. Wattergen is a conventional hydroelectrical turbine that can be placed in any household
                    plumbing pipe. The turbine is placed either parallel or perpendicular to the water flow in the pipe and it is rotated by the force of the
                    water flowing through the pipe. Furthermore, because the kinetic energy will have to be converted to electrical energy, a reverse generator, 
                    or a DC motor, will be connected to the turbine. When the turbine is rotated by the energy from the flow of the water, the axle connected to
                    the turbine from the DC motor will rotate as well, resulting in electrical energy being created. Similar to solar power, the energy generated
                    can either be stored for the benefit of the user or it can be returned back into the main power grid. </p>

                    <p> During this phase of the process, our team performed multiple calculations to discover if our solution was feasible and had the potential
                    to go positive. <br><br> In our first caclulation scenario, we set up a situation with 100 households and the total average amount of water that is drained out of each household on
                    a daily basis. Our team found that 55 gallons are used per 100 households every minute. This means that in a 2 inch pipe, water is pumped out at
                    a rate of 22.467 ft/sec. Assuming that the turbine is about 2 inches in diameter (most household drainage pipes are 2 inches in diameter), then the 
                    turbines from all 100 households would rotate at 429 RPM. In this scenario, it was found that $7.20 worth of electrical energy could be generated
                    every hour (60 kwh). This amount can also be scaled up because multiple turbines can be placed in multiple pipes in each household. <br><br> To confirm our
                    calculations, our team set up another scenario with the Burj Khalifa, the tallest skyscraper in the world. From an online source on the Burj Khalifa, 
                    we found that the building consumes about 250,000 gallons of water on avarage on a daily basis. This means that the building uses about 10,416 gallons
                    per hour or 173.6 gallons per minute. Since most drainage pipes are 2 inches in diameter, water is pumped out a rate of 70 ft/sec. When converted, this
                    equates to the turbine spinning at a rate of 8021 RPM. From this building alone, our idea could end up producing $129.58 worth of electrical energy 
                    every hour (1079.87 kwh). <br><br> With our calculations confirmed, we found that Wattergen had the potential to produce 5% of every community's energy if it was
                    implemented on the global scale. From the 100 households scenario, it was discovered that a 100 household community uses about 908,000 kw per month. $7.20 worth
                    of energy is equivalent to about 60 kw/hour. In a 100 household community, these turbines have the potential to generate at least 44,000 kw per month. 
                    In conclusion, consumers could automatically cut 5% from their energy bill by using our technology in their plumbing system.

                    <p> Due to the limited amount of time and resources available to our team, we developed a 3D model of our turbine using a 3D printer and PLA (Poly Lactic Acid)
                    plastic. The turbine was then attached to a DC motor to resemble the actual model that would be placed inside every household pipe. The final model will probably
                    be made of a larger DC motor attached to a turbine that is made out of a corrosion resistant metal (stainless steel, nickel, or titanium). To read more about our
