                    <p>Welcome to Wattergen! As both striving engineers and entrepreneurs, our team has designed a new and original product that can only be defined as the pinnacle of twenty-first century hydroelectrical power
                    innovation. As shown in the picture, our product is a simple down-scaled hydroelectrical turbine that can be placed in almost any conventional plumbing pipe where there is a consistent flow of water. Similar
                    to a hydroelectrical turbine in a dam, our turbine begins spinning once it comes into contact with the water flowing through the pipe. Then, the kinetic energy that is harnessed due to the spinning of the
                    turbine is converted to electrical energy via a generator that is connected to each of the turbines. The energy that is harnessed can then be returned back into the main power grid or stored locally for other uses.
                    Scroll down and navigate through our website to find out more about our product and how it can make a significant contribution on the global scale.

                    <p> Throughout the process of innovating this product, our team utilized a structured and agile design process to maximize efficiency, 
                    accuracy, and punctuality. In this type of design process, a problem is identified, a plan addressing the problem is created, the plan is reviewed
                    thoroughly, and it is executed via the creation of a prototype or a marketable final product. This process is repeated multiple times until a final
                    product has been created or the problem has been solved in the most efficient manner. Thus far, our team has successfully completed the first three
                    phases of the agile design process. Now, we must complete the final step by building and testing a physical full-scale prototype.

                    <p> Our product may look like a simple down-scaled turbine on the outside, but it could end up powering 5% of the world's electricity
                    if it is implemented universally. Furthermore, this is a revolutionary innovation because it produces clean energy with absolutely no 
                    drawbacks for the consumer or secondary harms to the environment. The turbine can even be scaled up or down to fit any size plumbing 
                    pipe by simply toggling its dimensions. Click on the "Product Info" tab in the navigation bar or click on the image to the left to 
                    read a more detailed explanation of our product and its specifications. </p>
